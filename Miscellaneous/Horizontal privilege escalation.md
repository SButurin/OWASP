Horizontal privilege escalation occurs if a user is able to gain access to resources belonging to another user, instead of their own resources of that type. For example, if an employee can access the records of other employees as well as their own, then this is horizontal privilege escalation.

Horizontal privilege escalation attacks may use similar types of exploit methods to vertical privilege escalation. For example, a user might access their own account page using the following URL:

`https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=123`

This lab has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page, but identifies users with GUIDs.

To solve the lab, find the GUID forÂ `carlos`, then submit his API key as the solution.



This lab is a blog so Carlos made a post and we can see find his username ID so we just add it here and we can see his API Key
